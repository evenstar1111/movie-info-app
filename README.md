# Movie Listing App with Next Js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

This app uses THE MOVIE DATABASE API (TMDB API) to show movies, tv shows and also enables searching for tvs, movies, persons & collections.

To use this code, clone it and add '.env.local' file to project root directory and set the 'KEY' Eenvironment Variable. Which should look like - <br /><br />

```
KEY='api_key=<YOUR API KEY HERE>'
```

<br /> To get an api key visit [`TMDB`](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an acount. For api documentation visit [`TMDB API`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
