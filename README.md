This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

This app uses THE MOVIE DATABASE API (TMDB API) to show movies, tv shows and also enables searching for tvs, movies, persons & collections.

I just learned basics of next js, and wanted to try out its feature. So, I decided to build this. And the code is not very optimized , well structured and might have mistakes. But I will try to make it better eventually. If suggest any modification that would be great.

If you want to use this code, clone it and add '.env.local' file to project root directory and set the 'KEY' Eenvironment Variable. Which should look like - <br /><br />

```
KEY='api_key=<YOUR API KEY HERE>'
```

<br /> To get an api key visit [`TMDB`](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an acount. For api documentation visit [`TMDB API`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## Deployment
